# DecisionReviewSystem
It is very well said that "Hard work betrays none". This project boosted my confidence to very higher extent. So in this project i made a third umpire decision review kit which will help the umpire to judge whether the person is out or not out. This can widely be used in gully cricket where there is always doubt over out or not out.
So that there will not be any cheating and play can continue without any interruption. I have used module like open cv, tkinter, imutils.
